        The rural communities of Dibutibu, Chisuma, and Sizinda
        villages faced severe challenges due to limited access to
        essential resources: clean drinking water, under-resourced
        schools, and minimal income-generating opportunities.
        Most families depended on subsistence farming in a dry,
        arid region with scarce rainfall, making daily survival and
        progress an ongoing struggle.
